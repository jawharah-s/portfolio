This folder contains SQL Server scripts created for my CIS 310 assignment using the StayWell dataset. 
I created and managed multiple tables, defined primary keys, inserted records, and verified table structures through metadata queries.
The scripts show my ability to:

Create relational tables
Apply correct data types and primary keys
Insert and manage records
Run queries to retrieve table data and metadata

All work was completed in Microsoft SQL Server as part of my database coursework.
